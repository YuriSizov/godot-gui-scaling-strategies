## GUI scaling strategies in Godot

An example Godot project that demonstrates different approaches to scaling GUI. There
are two ways showcased here: Control's `scale` property and Window's `content_scale_factor`.
Both come with different upsides and downsides which may fit your specific project or
not. Different considerations are given for games and apps made with the engine.

Alongside, this project also shows how assets can be adjusted to work at different scales.
Combined these approaches and tricks should inform your strategy when approaching
GUI scaling in your project.

### Getting started

To get started:

- Download or checkout this repository and open it in the Godot editor (tested with **4.3**).
- Run the main scene.

You will be welcomed by two windows: one for controlling the configuration options, and
another demonstrating the results. Each option comes with a hefty explanation giving it
additional context. Some code comments can also be relevant and of use.

An in-depth explanation of the problem and provided tips and solutions is
also **[available in this article](https://humnom.net/thoughts/67b7374e-the-simplest-way-to-scale-ui-in-godot.html)**.
