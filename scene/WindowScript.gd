extends Window


# HACK: This is a naive fix to an engine bug. For some reason, window's content scale factor
# affects controls' combined required minimum size, making it smaller the larger the scale is.
# This doesn't seem rational or logical, and the difference isn't even proportional to scale.
#
# Experimentally, I identified that global transform matrices of child controls help to
# counter-act the issue. So here we are. 
func _get_contents_minimum_size() -> Vector2:
	var content_min_size := Vector2.ZERO
	
	for child in get_children():
		if child is not Control:
			continue
		
		var child_control := child as Control
		var child_pos := child_control.position
		var child_min_size := (child_control.get_combined_minimum_size() * child_control.get_global_transform()).floor()
		content_min_size = content_min_size.max(child_pos + child_min_size)
	
	# Adjusting by the scale factor allows us to correctly shrink the window for scales < 1.0.
	# Previous logic was only tested with scales >= 1.0, which worked by happenstance.
	return content_min_size * content_scale_factor
